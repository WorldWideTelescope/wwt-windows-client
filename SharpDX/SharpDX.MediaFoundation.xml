            <p>These flags define video processing capabilities that are usually not needed, and therefore are not required for DXVA-HD devices to support.</p><p>The first three flags relate to RGB support for functions that are normally applied to YCbCr video: deinterlacing, color adjustment, and luma keying. A DXVA-HD device that supports these functions for YCbCr is not required  to support them for RGB input. Supporting RGB input for these functions  is  an additional capability, reflected by these constants. The driver might convert the input to another color space, perform the indicated function, and then convert the result back to RGB.</p><p>Similarly, a device that supports de-interlacing is not required to support deinterlacing of palettized formats. This capability is indicated by the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.InputFormatCaps.PaletteInterlaced"/></strong> flag.</p>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>To use this state, the device must support luma keying, indicated by the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.FeatureCaps.LumaKey"/></strong> capability flag. To query for this capability, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDDevice.GetVideoProcessorDeviceCaps(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps@)"/></strong>. If the device supports luma keying, it sets the  <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.FeatureCaps.LumaKey"/></strong> flag in the <strong>FeatureCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure.</p><p>If the device does not support luma keying, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDVideoProcessor.SetVideoProcessStreamState(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.StreamState,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> method fails for this state.</p><p>If the input format is RGB, the device must also support the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.InputFormatCaps.RgbLumaKey"/></strong> capability. This capability flag is set in the <strong>InputFormatCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure. If the flag is not present, the device ignores the luma key value for RGB input.</p><p>The values of <strong>Lower</strong> and <strong>Upper</strong> give the lower and upper bounds of the luma key, using a nominal range of [0...1]. Given a format with <em>n</em> bits per channel, these values are converted to luma values as follows:</p><p><code>val = f * ((1 &lt;&lt; n)-1)</code></p><p>Any pixel whose luma value falls within the upper and lower bounds (inclusive) is treated as transparent.</p><p>For example, if the pixel format uses 8-bit luma, the upper bound is calculated as follows:</p><p><code>BYTE Y = BYTE(max(min(1.0, Upper), 0.0) * 255.0)</code></p><p>Note that the value is clamped to the range [0...1] before multiplying by 255.</p>

            <p>The <strong>RGB_Range</strong> member applies to RGB output, while the <strong>YCbCr_Matrix</strong> and <strong>YCbCr_xvYCC</strong> members apply to YCbCr (YUV) output. If the device performs color-space conversion on the background color, it uses the values that apply to  both color spaces.</p><p>Extended YCbCr can be used with either transfer matrix. Extended YCbCr does not change the black point or white point?the black point is still 16 and the white point is still 235. However, extended YCbCr explicitly allows blacker-than-black values in the range 1?15, and whiter-than-white values in the range 236?254. When extended YCbCr is used, the driver should not clip the luma values to the nominal 16?235 range.</p><p>If the device supports extended YCbCr, it sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.DeviceCaps.XvYCC"/></strong> capability flag in the <strong>DeviceCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure. Otherwise, the device ignores the value of the <strong>YCbCr_xvYCC</strong> member and treats all YCbCr output as conventional YCbCr. To get the device's capabilities, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDDevice.GetVideoProcessorDeviceCaps(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps@)"/></strong>.</p><p>If the output format is a wide-gamut RGB format, output might fall outside the nominal [0...1] range of sRGB. This is particularly true if one or more input streams use extended YCbCr.</p>

            Input Surfaces<p>The Direct3D surfaces must be allocated in the memory pool specified by the <strong>InputPool</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure. The following surface types can be used:	
            </p><ul> <li>A video surface of type <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.SurfaceTypeHD.VideoInput"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.SurfaceTypeHD.VideoInputPrivate"/></strong>. See <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDDevice.CreateVideoSurface(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.SurfaceTypeHD,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface[],System.IntPtr)"/></strong>.</li> <li>A decoder render-target surface of type <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.RenderTargetType.VideoDecoder"/></strong>. See <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.VideoAccelerationService.CreateSurface(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Format,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D9.Surface[],System.IntPtr)"/></strong>.</li> <li>An off-screen plain surface.</li> </ul><p>The past and future reference frames must be placed in the arrays in temporal order, from oldest to newest. For example, if <em>T</em> is the current input frame, the arrays would be ordered as follows:</p><ul> <li><strong>ppPastSurfaces</strong>: { ?, <em>T</em>-3, <em>T</em>-2, <em>T</em>-1 }</li> <li><strong>ppInputSurface</strong>: <em>T</em></li> <li><strong>ppFutureSurfaces</strong>: { <em>T</em>+1, <em>T</em>+2, <em>T</em>+3, ? }</li> </ul><p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpcaps"/></strong> structure specifies the number of reference frames required to get the best deinterlacing quality. If the application provides fewer reference frames, the device will fall back to simpler deinterlacing algorithms. If no reference frames are provided, the device can use bob deinterlacing. Here are some cases where an application might provide fewer reference frames:</p><ul> <li>At the beginning or end of the video sequence</li> <li>With progressive input</li> <li>During a transition between progressive and interlaced input</li> <li>For a substream that does not require high deinterlacing quality</li> <li>While dropping frames</li> </ul>Input and Output Indexes<p>The <strong>OutputIndex</strong> and <strong>InputFrameOrField</strong> members are used to correlate input frames or fields with output frames. The value of the <strong>OutputIndex</strong> member is cyclic and resets to zero after each cycle.</p><p>Here are some example patterns:</p><ul> <li>Progressive video at normal rate. Each input frame produces one output frame.<ul> <li>Output index: 0, 0, 0, 0, ?</li> <li>Input index: 0, 1, 2, 3, ?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Interlaced video at normal rate. Each interlaced frame (two fields) produces two output frames.<ul> <li>Output index: 0, 1, 0, 1, ?</li> <li>Input index: 0, 1, 2, 3, ?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Progressive video at 2/1 output rate. Each input frame produces one output frame.<ul> <li>Output index: 0, 1, 0, 1, ?</li> <li>Input index: 0, 1, 2, 3, ?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Interlaced video at 1/2 output rate. Each interlaced frame produces one output frame. (The two fields are blended to create one frame.)<ul> <li>Output index: 0, 0, 0, 0, ?</li> <li>Input index: 0, 2, 4, 6, ?</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

            <remarks>	
            <p>To use this state, the device must support luma keying, indicated by the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.FeatureCaps.LumaKey"/></strong> capability flag. To query for this capability, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDDevice.GetVideoProcessorDeviceCaps(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps@)"/></strong>. If the device supports luma keying, it sets the  <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.FeatureCaps.LumaKey"/></strong> flag in the <strong>FeatureCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure.</p><p>If the device does not support luma keying, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.HDVideoProcessor.SetVideoProcessStreamState(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.StreamState,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> method fails for this state.</p><p>If the input format is RGB, the device must also support the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.InputFormatCaps.RgbLumaKey"/></strong> capability. This capability flag is set in the <strong>InputFormatCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DirectX.Vpdevcaps"/></strong> structure. If the flag is not present, the device ignores the luma key value for RGB input.</p><p>The values of <strong>Lower</strong> and <strong>Upper</strong> give the lower and upper bounds of the luma key, using a nominal range of [0...1]. Given a format with <em>n</em> bits per channel, these values are converted to luma values as follows:</p><p><code>val = f * ((1 &lt;&lt; n)-1)</code></p><p>Any pixel whose luma value falls within the upper and lower bounds (inclusive) is treated as transparent.</p><p>For example, if the pixel format uses 8-bit luma, the upper bound is calculated as follows:</p><p><code>BYTE Y = BYTE(max(min(1.0, Upper), 0.0) * 255.0)</code></p><p>Note that the value is clamped to the range [0...1] before multiplying by 255.</p>

If the input video is progressive or contains single fields, the output frame rate is the same as the input frame rate.</p><p>Decoders should set the values of <strong>InputSampleFreq</strong> and <strong>OutputFrameFreq</strong> if the frame rate is known. Otherwise, set these members to 0/0 to indicate an unknown frame rate.</p>

            <p>This topic describes the configuration settings for the default proxy locator. For information about creating the proxy locator with custom configuration settings, see How to Configure the Proxy Locator.</p><p>The proxy locator can be configured to operate in three modes: <em>manual mode</em>, <em>auto-detect mode</em>, and <em>browser mode</em>. The values are defined in <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.NetProxysettings"/></strong> enumeration. The application can configure the mode by setting the <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYSETTINGS</strong> property. The proxy locator can also be configured not to use a proxy server by setting this property to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.NetProxysettings.None"/></strong>. The proxy server is not used if the media server is a local host or the application requests a class A address (127.x.x.x)?reserved for loopback tests.</p><p><strong>Caution</strong>??A proxy server is a security barrier between your intranet and the Internet. Not using a proxy server can expose the network to security threats.</p><ul> <li> <p>Manual Mode. The application sets this mode by setting the <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYSETTING</strong> property to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.NetProxysettings.Manual"/></strong>. The application must specify the following connection information:</p> <ul> <li> Hostname of the proxy server: <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYHOSTNAME</strong> property. </li> <li> Port number: <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYPORT</strong> property. </li> <li> <p>Whether to use a proxy server for local addresses: <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYBYPASSFORLOCAL</strong> property. This setting is optional. If this is not specified, then the proxy locator uses a default value of <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>??By bypassing the proxy server, the application might be able to connect to media servers on the intranet faster.</p> </li> <li> List of media server addresses that do not require a proxy server to establish a connection:  <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYEXCEPTIONLIST</strong> property. This setting is optional. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Auto-Detect Mode. The application sets this mode by setting the <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYSETTING</strong> property to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.NetProxysettings.Auto"/></strong>. In this mode, the proxy locator uses the WinHTTP AutoProxy mechanism to get the hostname and the port number for the proxy server. This connection information is retrieved by using the WPAD auto proxy script, which is configured by the domain administrator. For more information about this mechanism, see the Microsoft website.</p> <p>The proxy locator caches the connection information in the registry. In subsequent proxy detection calls, the proxy locator reads proxy information from the registry cache to reduce the overhead involved in auto detection. However, the application can force auto proxy redetection by setting the <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYRERUNAUTODETECTION</strong> property.</p> </li> <li> Browser Mode. The application sets this mode by setting the <strong>MFNETSOURCE_PROXYSETTING</strong> property to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.NetProxysettings.Browser"/></strong>. In this mode, the proxy locator uses the proxy settings of the browser application. This mode is set by default if the protocol is HTTP or HTTPD. </li> </ul>

            <p>If the decoder sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdviseFlags.CannotKeepUp"/></strong> flag, the quality manager tries to reduce latency through the media source and the media sink. For example, it might request the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) to drop frames. During this period, the quality manager stops calling the decoder's <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdvise2.NotifyQualityEvent(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEvent,System.Int32@)"/></strong> method, until samples are no longer arriving late at the sink. At that point, the quality manager resumes calling <strong>NotifyQualityEvent</strong> on the decoder.</p>

            <p>In drop mode, a component drops samples, more or less aggressively depending on the level of the drop mode. The specific algorithm used depends on the component. Mode 1 is the least aggressive mode, and mode 5 is the most aggressive. A component is not required to implement all five levels.</p><p>For example, suppose an encoded video stream has three B-frames between each pair of P-frames. A decoder might implement the following drop modes:</p><ul> <li> <p>Mode 1: Drop one out of every three B frames.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mode 2: Drop one out of every two B frames.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mode 3: Drop all delta frames.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modes 4 and 5: Unsupported.</p> </li> </ul><p>The enhanced video renderer (EVR) can drop video frames before sending them to the EVR mixer.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p> Each successive quality level decreases the amount of processing that is needed, while also reducing the resulting quality of the audio or video. The specific algorithm used to reduce quality depends on the component. Mode 1 is the least aggressive mode, and mode 5 is the most aggressive. A component is not required to implement all five levels. Also, the same quality level might not be comparable between two different components. </p><p> Video decoders can often reduce quality by leaving out certain post-processing steps. The enhanced video renderer (EVR) can sometimes reduce quality by switching to a different deinterlacing mode. </p>

The input source stream attributes are copied to the output media type before the MFT node is inserted in the topology. If you set additional stream attributes, this flag does not overwrite the set values. Only the missing attributes are filled with the input source's attribute values. This flag is useful in remux scenario where you want to generate the output file in the same format as the input source. If you want to perform format conversion, make sure you set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaTypeAttributeKeys.Subtype"/></strong> attribute for the stream to specify the encoder that topology builder must use. The transform node is added in the topology unless <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TranscodeAttributeKeys.TranscodeDonotInsertEncoder"/> is set. In this case, and the content is not encoded. Instead, if permitted by the container, the content is embedded in the specified container. </p><p>For example, assume that your input source is an MP3 file.  You set the container to be <strong>MFTranscodeContainerType_ASF</strong>, you do not set any stream attributes, and you set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TranscodeAdjustProfileFlags.UseSourceAttributes"/></strong> flag. In this case, the generated output file is an ASF file (.wma)  containing MP3 media data. Note that if you use this flag, certain input stream attributes and the container type might not be compatible. </p>

            <p>Starting in Windows?7, Media Foundation provides an ASF streaming  sink that writes the content in  a live streaming scenario. This function should be used in secure transcode scenarios where this  media sink needs to be created and configured in the remote	
            process. Like the ASF file sink, the new media sink performs ASF related tasks such as writing the ASF header, generating data packets (muxing). The content is written to a caller-implemented byte stream such as an HTTP byte stream.	
            The caller must also provide an activation object that media sink can use to create the byte stream remotely.  </p><p>In addition, it performs transcryption for streaming protected content. It hosts the Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) for Network Devices Output Trust Authority (OTA) that handles the license request and response. For more information, see <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper"/></strong> interface.</p><p>The new media sink does not perform any time adjustments.  If the clock seeks, the timestamps are not changed.</p>

            <p>The sample copier is a Media Foundation transform (MFT) that copies data from input samples to output samples without modifying the data. The following data is copied from the sample:</p><ul> <li>All Sample Attributes.</li> <li>The time stamp and duration.</li> <li>Sample flags (see <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample.SetSampleFlags(System.Int32)"/></strong>).</li> <li>The data in the media buffers. If the input sample contains multiple buffers, the data is copied into a single buffer on the output sample.</li> </ul><p>This MFT is useful in the following situation:</p><ul> <li>One pipeline object, such as a media source, allocates media samples for output.</li> <li>Another pipeline object, such as a media sink, allocates its own media samples for input. For example, the object might require buffers allocated from a special memory pool, such as video memory.</li> </ul><p>The following diagram shows this situation with a media source and a media sink.</p><p></p><p>In order for the media sink to receive data from the media source, the data must be copied into the media samples owned by the media sink. The sample copier can be used for this purpose.</p><p>A specific example of such a media sink is the  Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR). The EVR allocates samples that contain Direct3D surface buffers, so it cannot receive video samples directly from a media source. Starting in Windows?7, the topology loader automatically handles this case by inserting the sample copier between the media source and the EVR.</p>

This method will depend on the type of object. Possibilities include:<ul> <li>Media sources: Call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSource.Shutdown"/></strong>.</li> <li>Media sinks: Call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSink.Shutdown"/></strong>.</li> <li>Any object that supports the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Shutdownable"/></strong> interface: Call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Shutdownable.Shutdown"/></strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul><p>The <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate.ShutdownObject"/></strong> method is generic to all object types. If the object does not require a shutdown method, <strong>ShutdownObject</strong> succeeds and has no effect. If you do not know the specific shutdown method for the object (or do not know the object type), call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate.ShutdownObject"/></strong>.</p><p> After the first call to <strong>ActivateObject</strong>, subsequent calls return a reference to the same instance, until the client calls either <strong>ShutdownObject</strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate.DetachObject"/></strong>. </p>

Therefore the Media Session, not the application, calls <strong>ShutdownObject</strong>.</p><p>After <strong>ShutdownObject</strong> is called, the activation object releases all of its internal references to the created object. If you call <strong>ActivateObject</strong> again, the activation object will create a new instance of the other object.</p>

            <p>The ASF indexer creates indexes for a file internally. You can get the completed index for all data packets sent to the indexer by committing the index with <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFIndexer.CommitIndex(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFContentInfo)"/></strong> and then calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFIndexer.GetCompletedIndex(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer,System.Int64)"/></strong> to write the index entries into a media buffer. To determine the size of the index so you can allocate a buffer large enough to hold the index, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFIndexer.GetIndexWriteSpace(System.Int64)"/></strong>.</p><p> When this method creates index entries, they are immediately available for use by <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFIndexer.GetSeekPositionForValue(SharpDX.Win32.Variant,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsfIndexIdentifier@,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.Int32)"/></strong>. </p><p> The media sample specified in   <em>pIASFPacketSample</em> must hold a buffer that contains a single ASF packet. Get the sample from the  ASF multiplexer by calling the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFMultiplexer.GetNextPacket(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample@)"/></strong> method. </p><p>You cannot use this method while reading an index, only when writing an index.</p>

            <p>For non-live encoding scenarios (such as encoding to a file), the user should call <strong>End</strong> to update the specified ContentInfo object, adding data that the multiplexer has collected during the packet generation process. The user should then call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFContentInfo.GenerateHeader(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer,System.Int32)"/></strong> and write the output header at the beginning of the ASF file (overwriting the header obtained at the beginning of the encoding session). For more information, see Writing an ASF Header Object for a New File.</p><p>During live encoding, it is usually not possible to rewrite the header, so this call is not required for live encoding. (The header in those cases will simply lack some of the information that was not available until the end of the encoding session.)</p>

            <p><strong>Applies to: </strong>desktop apps | Metro style apps</p><p> Represents a buffer that contains a two-dimensional surface, such as a video frame. </p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>To get a reference to this interface, call <strong>QueryInterface</strong> on the media buffer.</p><p>To use a 2-D buffer, it is important to know the <em>stride</em>, which is the number of bytes needed to go from one row of pixels to the next. The stride may be larger than the image width, because the surface may contain padding bytes after each row of pixels. Stride can also be negative, if the pixels are oriented bottom-up in memory. For more information, see Image Stride.</p><p>Every video format defines a <em>contiguous</em> or <em>packed</em> representation. This representation is compatible with the standard layout of a DirectX surface in system memory, with no additional padding. For RGB video, the contiguous representation has a pitch equal to the image width in bytes, rounded up to the nearest <strong>DWORD</strong> boundary. For YUV video, the layout of the contiguous representation depends on the YUV format. For planar YUV formats, the Y plane might have a different pitch than the U and V planes.</p><p>If a media buffer supports the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Buffer2D"/></strong> interface, the underlying buffer is not guaranteed to have a contiguous representation, because there might be additional padding bytes after each row of pixels. When a buffer is non-contiguous, the <strong>Lock</strong> and <strong>Lock2D</strong> methods have different behaviors:</p><ul> <li> The <strong>Lock2D</strong> method returns a reference to the underlying buffer. The buffer might not be contiguous. </li> <li> The <strong>Lock</strong> method returns a buffer that is guaranteed to be contiguous. If the underlying buffer is not contiguous, the method copies the data into a new buffer, and the <strong>Unlock</strong> method copies it back into the original buffer. </li> </ul><p>Call the <strong>Lock2D</strong> method to access the 2-D buffer in its native format. The native format might not be contiguous. The buffer's <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.Lock(System.Int32@,System.Int32@)"/></strong> method returns a contiguous representation of the buffer. However, this might require an internal copy from the native format. For 2-D buffers, therefore, you should use the <strong>Lock2D</strong> method and avoid the <strong>Lock</strong> method. Because the <strong>Lock</strong> method might cause up to two buffer copies, the <strong>Lock2D</strong> method is generally more efficient and should be used when possible. To find out if the underlying buffer is contiguous, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Buffer2D.IsContiguousFormat_(SharpDX.Bool@)"/></strong>.</p><p>For uncompressed images, the amount of valid data in the buffer is determined by the width, height, and pixel layout of the image. For this reason, if you call <strong>Lock2D</strong> to access the buffer, do not rely on the values returned by <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.GetCurrentLength(System.Int32@)"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.GetMaxLength(System.Int32@)"/></strong>. Similarly, if you modify the data in the buffer, you do not have to call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.SetCurrentLength(System.Int32)"/></strong> to update the size. Generally, you should avoid mixing calls to <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Buffer2D"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer"/></strong> methods on the same media buffer.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p> If a byte stream implements this interface, a media source can use it to control how the byte stream buffers data. This interface is designed for byte streams that read data from a network. </p><p> A byte stream that implements this interface should also implement the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventGenerator"/></strong> interface. When the byte stream starts buffering, it sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> event. When it stops buffering, it sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStopped"/> event. </p><p> The byte stream must send a matching <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStopped"/> event for every <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> event. The byte stream must not send <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> events unless the media source has enabled buffering by calling <strong>EnableBuffering</strong> with the value <strong>TRUE</strong>. </p><p> After the byte stream sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> event, it should send <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStopped"/> if any of the following occur: </p><ul> <li> The byte stream finishes buffering data. </li> <li> The byte stream reaches the end of the stream. </li> <li> The media source calls <strong>EnableBuffering</strong> with the value <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>. </li> <li> The media source calls <strong>StopBuffering</strong>. </li> </ul><p> The byte stream should not send any more buffering events after it reaches the end of the file. </p><p> If buffering is disabled, the byte stream does not send any buffering events. Internally, however, it might still buffer data while it waits for I/O requests to complete. Therefore, <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IByteStream"/></strong> methods might take an indefinite length of time to complete. </p><p> If the byte stream is buffering data internally and the media source calls <strong>EnableBuffering</strong> with the value <strong>TRUE</strong>, the byte stream can send <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> immediately. </p><p> After the presentation has started, the media source should forward and <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStarted"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.BufferingStopped"/> events that it receives while started. The Media Session will pause the presentation clock while buffering is progress and restart the presentation clock when buffering completes. The media source should only forward these events while the presentation is playing. The purpose of sending these events to the Media Session is to pause the presentation time while the source buffers data. </p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>At some fixed interval, a clock correlates its internal clock ticks with the system time. (The system time is the time returned by the high-resolution performance counter.) This method returns:</p><ul> <li> The most recent clock time that was correlated with system time. </li> <li> The system time when the correlation was performed. </li> </ul><p> The clock time is returned in the <em>pllClockTime</em> parameter and is expressed in units of the clock's frequency. If the clock's <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Clock.GetClockCharacteristics(System.Int32@)"/></strong> method returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockCharacteristicsFlags.Frequency10mhz"/></strong> flag, the clock's frequency is 10 MHz (each clock tick is 100 nanoseconds). Otherwise, you can get the clock's frequency by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Clock.GetProperties(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties@)"/></strong>. The frequency is given in the <strong>qwClockFrequency</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties"/></strong> structure returned by that method. </p><p> The system time is returned in the <em>phnsSystemTime</em> parameter, and is always expressed in 100-nanosecond units. </p><p> To find out how often the clock correlates its clock time with the system time, call <strong>GetProperties</strong>. The correlation interval is given in the <strong>qwCorrelationRate</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties"/></strong> structure. If <strong>qwCorrelationRate</strong> is zero, it means the clock performs the correlation whenever <strong>GetCorrelatedTime</strong> is called. Otherwise, you can calculate the current clock time by extrapolating from the last correlated time. </p><p> Some clocks support rate changes through the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.RateControl"/></strong> interface. If so, the clock time advances at a speed of frequency ? current rate. If a clock does not expose the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.RateControl"/></strong> interface, the rate is always 1.0. </p><p>For the presentation clock, the clock time is the presentation time, and is always relative to the starting time specified in <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.Start(System.Int64)"/></strong>. You can also get the presentation time by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.GetTime(System.Int64@)"/></strong>.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>At some fixed interval, a clock correlates its internal clock ticks with the system time. (The system time is the time returned by the high-resolution performance counter.) This method returns:</p><ul> <li> The most recent clock time that was correlated with system time. </li> <li> The system time when the correlation was performed. </li> </ul><p> The clock time is returned in the <em>pllClockTime</em> parameter and is expressed in units of the clock's frequency. If the clock's <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Clock.GetClockCharacteristics(System.Int32@)"/></strong> method returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockCharacteristicsFlags.Frequency10mhz"/></strong> flag, the clock's frequency is 10 MHz (each clock tick is 100 nanoseconds). Otherwise, you can get the clock's frequency by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Clock.GetProperties(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties@)"/></strong>. The frequency is given in the <strong>qwClockFrequency</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties"/></strong> structure returned by that method. </p><p> The system time is returned in the <em>phnsSystemTime</em> parameter, and is always expressed in 100-nanosecond units. </p><p> To find out how often the clock correlates its clock time with the system time, call <strong>GetProperties</strong>. The correlation interval is given in the <strong>qwCorrelationRate</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockProperties"/></strong> structure. If <strong>qwCorrelationRate</strong> is zero, it means the clock performs the correlation whenever <strong>GetCorrelatedTime</strong> is called. Otherwise, you can calculate the current clock time by extrapolating from the last correlated time. </p><p> Some clocks support rate changes through the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.RateControl"/></strong> interface. If so, the clock time advances at a speed of frequency ? current rate. If a clock does not expose the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.RateControl"/></strong> interface, the rate is always 1.0. </p><p>For the presentation clock, the clock time is the presentation time, and is always relative to the starting time specified in <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.Start(System.Int64)"/></strong>. You can also get the presentation time by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.GetTime(System.Int64@)"/></strong>.</p>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>A <em>content enabler</em> is an object that performs some action that is required to play a piece of protected content. For example, the action might be obtaining a DRM license. Content enablers expose the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentEnabler"/></strong> interface, which defines a generic mechanism for content enabler. Content enablers are created inside the protected media path (PMP) process. However, they must be invoked from the application process. Therefore, the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentProtectionManager"/></strong> interface provides a way for the PMP Media Session to notify the application.</p><p>To use this interface, do the following:</p><ol> <li> <p>Implement the interface in your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create an attribute store by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.CreateAttributes(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaAttributes,System.Int32)"/></strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSessionAttributeKeys.ContentProtectionManager"/></strong> attribute on the attribute store. The attribute value is a reference to your <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentProtectionManager"/></strong> implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.CreatePMPMediaSession(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaAttributes,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSession@,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate@)"/></strong> and pass the attribute store in the <em>pConfiguration</em> parameter.</p> </li> </ol><p>If the content requires a content enabler, the application's <strong>BeginEnableContent</strong> method is called. Usually this method called during the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSession.SetTopology(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Topology)"/></strong> operation, before the Media Session raises the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SessionTopologySet"/> event. The application might receive multiple <strong>BeginEnableContent</strong> calls for a single piece of content. The <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SessionTopologySet"/> event signals that the content-enabling process is complete for the current topology. The <strong>BeginEnableContent</strong> method can also be called outside of the <strong>SetTopology</strong> operation, but less commonly.</p><p>Many content enablers send machine-specific data to the network, which can have privacy implications. One of the purposes of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentProtectionManager"/></strong> interface is to give applications an opportunity to display information to the user and enable to user to opt in or out of the process.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>To stream protected content over a network, the <em>ASF streaming media sink</em> provides an output trust authority (OTA) that supports  Windows Media DRM for Network Devices and implements the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper"/></strong> interface. For this OTA,  encryption occurs on each frame before multiplexing. The license request and response process takes place in the media sink.</p><p>The application gets a reference to <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper"/></strong> and uses the methods to handle the license request and response. The application is also responsible for sending the license to the client.</p><p>To stream the content, the application does the following:</p><ol> <li>Provide the HTTP byte stream to which the media sink writes the streamed content. <p>To stream DRM-protected content over a network from a server to a client, an application must use the Microsoft Media Foundation Protected Media Path (PMP). The media sink and the application-provided HTTP byte stream exist in  mfpmp.exe. Therefore, the byte stream must expose the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate"/></strong> interface so that it can be created out-of-process.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??This might affect how the code is packaged. The DLL that contains the HTTP byte stream and other dependent DLLs must be signed for the Protected Environment (PE-signed).  </p> </li> <li>Set the <strong>MFPKEY_ASFMEDIASINK_DRMACTION</strong> property to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SinkWmdrmaction.Transcrypt"/></strong>. The media sink's property store is available to the application through the ASF ContentInfo. To get the property store, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ASFContentInfo.GetEncodingConfigurationPropertyStore(System.Int16,SharpDX.ComObject@)"/></strong>.</li> <li>Get a reference to the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper"/></strong> interface by querying the media sink.</li> <li>To make a license request, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper.ProcessLicenseRequest(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Byte[],System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>. This method calls into the OTA implementation and retrieves the license.<p>When the clock starts for the first time or restarts , the encrypter that is used for encrypting samples is retrieved, and   the license response is cached.</p> </li> <li>To get the cached license response, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DRMNetHelper.GetChainedLicenseResponse(System.Byte[],System.Int32@)"/></strong>.</li> </ol>

            <p>Many archive media sinks have steps they need to do at the end of archiving to complete their file operations, such as updating the header (for some formats) or flushing all pending writes to disk.

At that point, the application should call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.FinalizableMediaSink.EndFinalize(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncResult)"/></strong> to complete the asynchronous request.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>During streaming, the media sink attempts to match rates with the presentation clock. Ideally, the media sink presents samples at the correct time according to the presentation clock and does not fall behind. Rateless media sinks are an exception to this rule, as they consume samples as quickly as possible and ignore the clock. If the sink is rateless, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSink.GetCharacteristics(System.Int32@)"/></strong> method returns the MEDIASINK_RATELESS flag.</p><p>The presentation clock must have a time source. Before calling this method, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.SetTimeSource(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationTimeSource)"/></strong> on the presentation clock to set the presentation time source. Some media sinks provide time sources; therefore, the media sink might be the time source for its own presentation clock. Regardless of what object provides the time source, however, the media sink must attempt to match rates with the clock specified in <em>pPresentationClock</em>. If a media sink cannot match rates with an external time source, the media sink's <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSink.GetCharacteristics(System.Int32@)"/></strong> method retrieves the MEDIASINK_CANNOT_MATCH_CLOCK flag. In this case, <strong>SetPresentationClock</strong> will still succeed, but the results will not be optimal. The sink might not render samples quickly enough to match rates with the presentation clock.</p><p>If <em>pPresentationClock</em> is non-<strong><c>null</c></strong>, the media sink must register for clock state notifications, by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.AddClockStateSink(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockStateSink)"/></strong> on the presentation clock. If the method is called again with a new presentation clock, or if <em>pPresentationClock</em> is <strong><c>null</c></strong>, the media sink must call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PresentationClock.RemoveClockStateSink(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ClockStateSink)"/></strong> to deregister itself from the previous clock.</p><p>All media sinks must support this method.</p>

            <p>If the application creates the media sink, it is responsible for calling <strong>Shutdown</strong> to avoid memory or resource leaks.

In that case, the Media Session ? not the application ? shuts down the media sink.

            <remarks>	
            <p>Call this method to enumerate an input stream's preferred media types. The DMO assigns each media type an index value in order of preference. The most preferred type has an index of zero. To enumerate all the types, make successive calls while incrementing the type index until the method returns DMO_E_NO_MORE_ITEMS. The DMO is not guaranteed to enumerate every media type that it supports.</p><p>The format block in the returned type might be <strong><c>null</c></strong>. If so, the format type is GUID_NULL. Check the format type before dereferencing the format block.</p><p>If the method succeeds, call <strong>MoFreeMediaType</strong> to free the format block. (This function is also safe to call when the format block is <strong><c>null</c></strong>.)</p><p>To set the media type, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IMediaObject.SetInputType(System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoMediaType},System.Int32)"/></strong> method. Setting the media type on one stream can change another stream's preferred types. In fact, a stream might not have a preferred type until the type is set on another stream. For example, a decoder might not have a preferred output type until the input type is set. However, the DMO is not required to update its preferred types dynamically in this fashion. Thus, the types returned by this method are not guaranteed to be valid; they might fail when used in the <strong>SetInputType</strong> method.</p><p>To test whether a particular media type is acceptable, call <strong>SetInputType</strong> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoSetTypeFlags.DmoSetTypefTestOnly"/> flag.</p><p>To test whether the <em>dwTypeIndex</em> parameter is in range, set <em>pmt</em> to <strong><c>null</c></strong>. The method returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> if the index is in range, or DMO_E_NO_MORE_ITEMS if the index is out of range.</p>

            <p>The latency is the difference between a time stamp on the input stream and the corresponding time stamp on the output stream. The maximum latency is the largest possible difference in the time stamps. For a DMO, determine the maximum latency as follows:</p><ul> <li>Process input buffers until the DMO can produce output. </li> <li>Process as many output buffers as possible. </li> <li>The maximum latency is the largest delta between input time stamps and output time stamps (taken as an absolute value). </li> </ul><p>Under this definition, latency does not include the time that it takes to process samples. Nor does it include any latency introduced by the size of the input buffer.</p><p>For the special case where a DMO processes exactly one sample at a time, the maximum latency is simply the difference in time stamps.</p><p>Latency is defined only when samples have time stamps, and the time stamps increase or decrease monotonically. Maximum latency might depend on the media types for the input and output streams.</p>

            <p>The <em>pOutputBuffers</em> parameter points to an array of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structures. The application must allocate one structure for each output stream. To determine the number of output streams, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IMediaObject.GetStreamCount(System.Int32@,System.Int32@)"/></strong> method. Set the <em>cOutputBufferCount</em> parameter to this number.</p><p>Each <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure contains a reference to a buffer's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IMediaBuffer"/></strong> interface. The application allocates these buffers. The other members of the structure are status fields. The DMO sets these fields if the method succeeds. If the method fails, their values are undefined.</p><p>When the application calls <code>ProcessOutput</code>, the DMO processes as much input data as possible. It writes the output data to the output buffers, starting from the end of the data in each buffer. (To find the end of the data, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IMediaBuffer.GetBufferAndLength(System.Byte[],System.Int32@)"/></strong> method.) The DMO never holds a reference count on an output buffer.</p><p>If the DMO fills an entire output buffer and still has input data to process, the DMO returns the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoOutputDataBufferFlags.DmoOutputDataBufferfIncomplete"/> flag in the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure. The application should check for this flag by testing the <strong>dwStatus</strong> member of each structure.</p><p>If the method returns S_FALSE, no output was generated. However, a DMO is not required to return S_FALSE in this situation; it might return <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/>.</p><p><strong>Discarding data:</strong></p><p>You can discard data from a stream by setting the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoProcessOutputFlags.DmoProcessOutputDiscardWhenNoBuffer"/> flag in the <em>dwFlags</em> parameter. For each stream that you want to discard, set the <strong>pBuffer</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure to <strong><c>null</c></strong>.</p><p>For each stream in which <strong>pBuffer</strong> is <strong><c>null</c></strong>:</p><ul> <li>If the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.DmoProcessOutputFlags.DmoProcessOutputDiscardWhenNoBuffer"/> flag is set, and the stream is discardable or optional, the DMO discards the data.</li> <li>If the flag is set but the stream is neither discardable nor optional, the DMO discards the data if possible. It is not guaranteed to discard the data.</li> <li>If the flag is not set, the DMO does not produce output data for that stream, but does not discard the data.</li> </ul><p>To check whether a stream is discardable or optional, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.IMediaObject.GetOutputStreamInfo(System.Int32,System.Int32@)"/></strong> method.</p>

            <p>This method verifies whether the user has permission to perform a specified action on the stream. The ITA does any work needed to verify the user's right to perform the action, such as checking licenses.</p><p>To verify the user's rights, the ITA might need to perform additional steps that require interaction with the user or consent from the user. For example, it might need to acquire a new license or individualize a DRM component. In that case, the ITA creates an activation object for a content enabler and returns the activation object's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate"/></strong> interface in the <em>ppContentEnablerActivate</em> parameter. The activation object is responsible for creating a content enabler that exposes the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentEnabler"/></strong> interface. The content enabler is used as follows:</p><ol> <li> <p>The Media Session returns the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate"/></strong> reference to the application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The application calls <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate.ActivateObject(System.Guid,System.IntPtr@)"/></strong> to activate the content enabler.</p> </li> <li> <p>The application calls <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentEnabler"/></strong> methods to perform whatever actions are needed, such as individualization or obtaining a license. The content enabler object must encapsulate this functionality through the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.ContentEnabler"/></strong> interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Media Session calls <strong>RequestAccess</strong> again.</p> </li> </ol><p>The return value signals whether the user has permission to perform the action:</p><ul> <li> <p>If the user already has permission to perform the action, the method returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> and sets *<em>ppContentEnablerActivate</em> to <strong><c>null</c></strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the user does not have permission, the method returns a failure code and sets *<em>ppContentEnablerActivate</em> to <strong><c>null</c></strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the ITA must perform additional steps that require interaction with the user, the method returns a failure code and returns the content enabler's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate"/></strong> reference in <em>ppContentEnablerActivate</em>.</p> </li> </ul><p>The Media Session will not allow the action unless this method returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/>. However, a return value of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/> does not guarantee that the action will be performed, because some other failure might occur after this method is called. When the action is definitely about to happen, the Media Session calls <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.InputTrustAuthority.BindAccess(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.InputtrustauthorityAccessParams@)"/></strong>.</p><p>A stream can go to multiple outputs, so this method might be called multiple times with different actions, once for every output.</p>

            <p>This method gives the caller access to the entire buffer, up to the maximum size returned in the <em>pcbMaxLength</em> parameter. The value returned in <em>pcbCurrentLength</em> is the size of any valid data already in the buffer, which might be less than the total buffer size.</p><p>The reference returned in <em>ppbBuffer</em> is guaranteed to be valid, and can safely be accessed across the entire buffer for as long as the lock is held. When you are done accessing the buffer, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.Unlock"/></strong> to unlock the buffer. You must call <strong>Unlock</strong> once for each call to <strong>Lock</strong>. After you unlock the buffer, the reference returned in <em>ppbBuffer</em> is no longer valid, and should not be used. Generally, it is best to call <strong>Lock</strong> only when you need to access the buffer memory, and not earlier.</p><p>Locking the buffer does not prevent other threads from calling <strong>Lock</strong>, so you should not rely on this method to synchronize threads.</p><p>This method does not allocate any memory, or transfer ownership of the memory to the caller. Do not release or free the memory; the media buffer will free the memory when the media buffer is destroyed.</p><p>If you modify the contents of the buffer, update the current length by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaBuffer.SetCurrentLength(System.Int32)"/></strong>.</p><p>If the buffer supports the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Buffer2D"/></strong> interface, you should use the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Buffer2D.Lock2D(System.Byte@,System.Int32)"/></strong> method to lock the buffer. For 2-D buffers, the <strong>Lock2D</strong> method is more efficient than the <strong>Lock</strong> method. If the buffer is locked using <strong>Lock2D</strong>, the Lock method might return <strong>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</strong>.</p><p>This interface is available on the following platforms if the Windows Media Format 11 SDK redistributable components are installed:</p><ul> <li>Windows?XP with Service Pack?2 (SP2) and later.</li> <li>Windows?XP Media Center Edition?2005 with KB900325 (Windows?XP Media Center Edition?2005) and KB925766 (October 2006 Update Rollup for Windows?XP Media Center Edition) installed.</li> </ul>

            <p>This method is asynchronous. If the operation succeeds, the media source sends the following events:</p><ul> <li> For each new stream, the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.NewStream"/> event. This event is sent for the first <strong>Start</strong> call in which the stream appears. The event data is a reference to the stream's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaStream"/></strong> interface. </li> <li> For each <em>updated</em> stream, the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.UpdatedStream"/> event. A stream is updated if the stream already existed when <strong>Start</strong> was called (for example, if the application seeks during playback). The event data is a reference to the stream's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaStream"/></strong> interface. </li> <li> If the previous state was stopped, the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceStarted"/> event. </li> <li> If the previous state was started or paused and the starting position is the current position (<strong>VT_EMPTY</strong>), the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceStarted"/> event. </li> <li> If the previous state was started or paused, and a new starting position is specified, the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceSeeked"/> event. </li> <li> If the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceStarted"/> event, each media stream sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamStarted"/> event. If the source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceSeeked"/> event, each stream sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamSeeked"/> event. </li> </ul><p> If the start operation fails asynchronously (after the method returns <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok"/></strong>), the media source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceStarted"/> event that contains a failure code, without sending any of the other events listed here. If the method fails synchronously (returns an error code), no events are raised. </p><p> A call to <strong>Start</strong> results in a <em>seek</em> if the previous state was started or paused, and the new starting position is not <strong>VT_EMPTY</strong>. Not every media source can seek. If a media source can seek, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSource.GetCharacteristics(System.Int32@)"/></strong> method returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediasourceCharacteristics.CanSeek"/></strong> flag. </p><p> Events from the media source are not synchronized with events from the media streams. If you seek a media source, therefore, you can still receive samples from the earlier position after getting the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.SourceSeeked"/> event. If you need to synchronize the operations, wait for the stream event, <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamSeeked"/>, which marks the exact point in the stream where the seek occurs. </p>End of Stream<p>When a stream plays to the end, the stream sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfStream"/> event. When all of the selected streams have reached the end, the media source sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfPresentation"/> event.</p><p>If the starting position is past the end of a selected stream (but before the end of the presentation), the stream should send <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfStream"/> immediately after <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamStarted"/>/<see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamSeeked"/>. If playback reaches the end of the presentation and <strong>Start</strong> is called again from the current position, the streams re-send the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfStream"/> event and the media source re-sends the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfPresentation"/> event. These events inform the pipeline not to request any more data.</p><p>During reverse playback, the start of the file is considered the end of the stream. For more information, see Implementing Rate Control.</p>Implementing Start<p>When a media source executes a seek, it should start at the first key frame before the seek time, so that the decoder can decode the samples for the target start time. The pipeline will discard any decoded samples that are too early.</p><p>If the start time is <strong>VT_EMPTY</strong> and the previous state was started or paused, the source should resume from its current position. In this case, it is not necessary to resend the previous key frame, because the decoder will still have the data that was previously sent.</p><p>When validating the  <em>pPresentationDescriptor</em> parameter, the media source should check only for the information that it needs to function correctly. In particular, the client can add private attributes to the presentation descriptor. The presence of additional attributes should not cause the <strong>Start</strong> method to fail.</p><p>After <strong>Start</strong> is called, each stream on the media source must do one of the following:</p><ul> <li>Deliver media data in response to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaStream.RequestSample(SharpDX.ComObject)"/></strong> calls.</li> <li>Send <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.StreamTick"/> events to indicate a gap in the stream.</li> <li>Send an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.EndOfStream"/> event to indicate the end of the stream.</li> </ul><p>For more information, see Writing a Custom Media Source.</p>

            <p>If <em>pToken</em> is not <strong><c>null</c></strong>, the media stream calls <strong>AddRef</strong> on <em>pToken</em> and places the token in a first-in, first-out queue.</p><p>When the next sample is available, the media stream stream does the following:</p><ol> <li> Pulls the first token from the queue. </li> <li> Sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SampleAttributeKeys.Token"/></strong> attribute on the media sample. The attribute data is a reference to the token object. </li> <li> Sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.MediaSample"/> event. The event data is a reference to the media sample's <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample"/></strong> interface. </li> <li> Calls <strong>Release</strong> on the token. </li> </ol><p>If the media stream cannot fulfill the caller's request for a sample, it simply releases the token object and skips steps 2 and 3.</p><p>The caller should monitor the reference count on the request token. If the media stream sends an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.MediaSample"/> event, get the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SampleAttributeKeys.Token"/></strong> attribute from the sample and match the attribute value against the token. If the token's reference count falls to zero and you did not receive an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.MediaSample"/> event, it means that the request was dropped.</p><p>Because the Media Foundation pipeline is multithreaded, the source's <strong>RequestSample</strong> method might get called after the source has stopped. If the media source is stopped, the method should return <strong>MF_E_MEDIA_SOURCE_WRONGSTATE</strong>. The pipeline does not treat this return code as an error condition. If the source returns any other error code, the pipeline treats it as fatal error and halts the session.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??Earlier versions of the documentation listed the wrong error code for this case.</p><p>If the media source is paused, the method succeeds, but the stream does not deliver the sample until the source is started again.</p><p>If a media source enounters an error asynchronously while processing data, it should signal the error in one of the following ways (but not both):</p><ul> <li>Return an error code from the next <strong>RequestSample</strong> call.</li> <li>Send an <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.Error"/> event.</li> </ul>

            <summary>	
            <p>This topic describes how to implement the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncResult"/></strong> interface.</p><p>It is rare that you will need to write a custom implementation of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncResult"/></strong> interface. In almost all cases, the standard Media Foundation implementation is sufficient. (This implementation is returned by the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.CreateAsyncResult(SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncCallback,SharpDX.ComObject,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncResult@)"/></strong> function.) However, if you do write a custom implementation, there are some issues to be aware of.</p><p>First, your implementation must inherit the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Mfasyncresult"/></strong> structure. The Media Foundation work queues use this structure internally to dispatch the operation. Initialize all of the structure members to zero, except for the <strong>pCallback</strong> member, which contains a reference to the caller's callback interface.</p><p>Second, your object should call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.LockPlatform"/></strong> in its constructor, to lock the Media Foundation platform. Call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.UnlockPlatform"/></strong> to unlock the platform. These functions help to prevent the platform from shutting down before the object is destroyed. For more information, see Work Queues.</p><p>The following code shows a basic implementation of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AsyncResult"/></strong> interface. As shown, this code provides no additional features beyond the standard Media Foundation implementation. </p><pre>///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>Media Foundation provides a set of built-in media sources and decoders. Applications can enumerate them as follows: </p><ul> <li>Media sources are enumerated through the Source Resolver.</li> <li>Transforms, such as decoders, are enumerated through the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.TEnum(System.Guid,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaAttributes,System.Guid[],System.Int32@)"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.TEnumEx(System.Guid,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate[],System.Int32@)"/></strong> functions.</li> </ul><p>Applications might also enumerate these objects indirectly. For example, if an application   uses the topology loader to resolve a partial topology, the topology loader calls <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.TEnumEx(System.Guid,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TRegisterTypeInformation},SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate[],System.Int32@)"/></strong> to find the required decoders.</p><p>Third parties can implement their own custom media sources and decoders, and register them for enumeration so that other applications can use them.</p><p>To control the enumeration order, Media Foundation maintains two process-wide lists of CLSIDs: a preferred list and a blocked list.  An object whose CLSID appears in the preferred list appears first in the enumeration order. An object whose CLSID appears on the blocked list is not enumerated.</p><p>The lists are initially populated from the registry. Applications can use the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PluginControl"/></strong> interface to modify the lists for the current process.</p><p>The preferred list contains a set of key/value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values are CLSIDs. These key/value pairs are defined as follows:</p><ul> <li>For media sources, the key name is a file name extension, protocol scheme, or MIME type. The value is the CLSID of a scheme handler or byte-stream handler for that media source.</li> <li>For decoders, the key name is a media subtype <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> in canonical string form. (For more information about media subtypes, see Media Types.) The value is the CLSID of the Media Foundation transform (MFT) that implements the decoder. </li> </ul><p>The following examples show the various types of key:</p><ul> <li>File extension: ".wmv"</li> <li>Scheme: "http:"</li> <li>MIME type: "video/mp4"</li> <li>Media subtype: "{47504A4D-0000-0010-8000-00AA00389B71}"</li> </ul><p>To search the preferred list by key name, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PluginControl.GetPreferredClsid(System.Int32,System.String,System.Guid@)"/></strong> method. To enumerate the entire list, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PluginControl.GetPreferredClsidByIndex(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr,System.Guid@)"/></strong> method in a loop.</p><p>The blocked list contains a list of CLSIDs. To enumerate the entire list, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PluginControl.GetDisabledByIndex(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid@)"/></strong> method in a loop. To check whether a specific CLSID appears on the list, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PluginControl.IsDisabled(System.Int32,System.Guid)"/></strong> method.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>The object specified in the <em>pEffect</em> parameter can implement either a video effect or an audio effect. The effect is applied to any media items set after the method is called. It is not applied to the current media item. </p><p>For each media item, the effect is applied to the first selected stream of the matching type (audio or video). If a media item has two selected streams of the same type, the second stream does not receive the effect. The effect is ignored if the media item does not contain a stream that matches the effect type. For example, if you set a video effect and play a file that contains just audio, the video effect is ignored, although no error is raised.</p><p>The effect is applied to all subsequent media items, until the application removes the effect. To remove an effect, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PMediaPlayer.RemoveEffect(SharpDX.ComObject)"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.PMediaPlayer.RemoveAllEffects"/></strong>.</p><p>If you set multiple effects of the same type (audio or video), they are applied in the same order in which you call <strong>InsertEffect</strong>.</p>Remote Playback Optimizations<p>Audio and video effects might be incompatible with optimizations that are used for remote playback. The following remarks apply only to audio or video effects that are actually used during playback:</p><ul> <li>If you mark an audio or video effect as required, by setting <em>fOptional</em> to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>, MFPlay disables remote playback optimizations.</li> <li>Otherwise, if all audio/video effects are marked as optional, MFPlay  might drop the effects, in order to enable remote playback optimizations.</li> </ul><p>In other words, required effects have priority over remote optimizations, but optional effects do not.</p><p>Remote optimizations might be disabled for other reasons. For example, they are disabled if you set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MfpCreationOptions.MfpOptionNoRemoteDesktopOptimization"/></strong> option when you create the player object. In that case, MFPlay will attempt to insert any optional effects. </p><p>Non-audio, non-video effects do not affect remote optimizations. Also, if you insert a required effect but the source does not contain any streams of that type, remote optimizations are not disabled.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>Ideally the quality manager can prevent a renderer from falling behind. But if this does occur, then simply lowering quality does not guarantee the renderer will ever catch up. As a result, audio and video might fall out of sync. To correct this problem, the quality manager can call <strong>DropTime</strong> to request that the renderer drop samples quickly over a specified time interval. After that period, the renderer stops dropping samples.</p><p>This method is primarily intended for the video renderer. Dropped audio samples cause audio glitching, which is not desirable.</p><p>If a component does not support this method, it should return MF_E_DROPTIME_NOT_SUPPORTED.</p>

Currently, it is supported only for video decoders.</p><p>If a video decoder exposes <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdvise"/></strong> but not <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdvise2"/></strong>, the quality manager controls quality adjustments for the decoder. In this case, the quality manager responds to <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.QualityNotify"/> events from the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) by calling <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdvise"/></strong> methods on the decoder.</p><p>If the decoder exposes <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.QualityAdvise2"/></strong>, the quality manager forwards the <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventTypes.QualityNotify"/> events to the decoder and does not adjust the decoder's quality settings. The decoder should respond to these events by adjusting its own quality settings internally.</p><p>The preceding remarks apply to the default implementation of the quality manager; custom quality managers can implement other behaviors.</p><p>This interface is available on Windows?Vista if Platform Update Supplement for Windows?Vista is installed.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>For some formats (such as ASF), thinning means dropping all frames that are not I-frames. If a component produces stream data, such as a media source or a demultiplexer, it should pay attention to the <em>fThin</em> parameter and return MF_E_THINNING_UNSUPPORTED if it cannot thin the stream.</p><p>If the component processes or receives a stream (most transforms or media sinks), it may ignore this parameter if it does not care whether the stream is thinned. In the Media Session's implementation of rate support, if the transforms do not explicitly support reverse playback, the Media Session will attempt to playback in reverse with thinning but not without thinning. Therefore, most applications will set <em>fThin</em> to <strong>TRUE</strong> when using the Media Session for reverse playback.</p><p>If <em>eDirection</em> is <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.RateDirection.Reverse"/>, the method retrieves the fastest reverse playback rate. This is a negative value, assuming the object supports reverse playback.</p>

You can use the attributes to get information about the sample, such as  field dominance and telecine flags. </p><p>To use this interface, do the following: </p><ol> <li>Implement  a callback object that exposes the interface.</li> <li>Create the sample-grabber sink by calling the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.CreateSampleGrabberSinkActivate(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaType,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SampleGrabberSinkCallback,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate@)"/></strong> function. Pass the callback reference in the <em>pIMFSampleGrabberSinkCallback</em> parameter.</li> <li>The sample-grabber sink will call <strong>QueryInterface</strong> on the callback object.</li> <li>If the callback object exposes the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SampleGrabberSinkCallback2"/></strong> interface, the sample-grabber sink will use the <strong>OnProcessSampleEx</strong> callback method.  Otherwise, the sample-grabber sink will use the older <strong>OnProcessSample</strong> callback method.</li> </ol>

The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AudioStreamVolume"/></strong> interface is supported by the SAR only.</p><p>Volume is expressed as an attenuation level, where 0.0 indicates silence and 1.0 indicates full volume (no attenuation). For each channel, the attenuation level is the product of:</p><ul> <li> <p>The master volume level of the audio session.</p> </li> <li> <p>The volume level of the channel.</p> </li> </ul><p>For example, if the master volume is 0.8 and the channel volume is 0.5, the attenuaton for that channel is 0.8 ? 0.5 = 0.4. Volume levels can exceed 1.0 (positive gain), but the audio engine clips any audio samples that exceed zero decibels. To change the volume level of individual channels, use the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.AudioStreamVolume"/></strong> interface.</p><p>Use the following formula to convert the volume level to the decibel (dB) scale:</p><p> Attenuation (dB) = 20 * log10(<em>Level</em>) </p><p>For example, a volume level of 0.50 represents 6.02 dB of attenuation.</p>

            <p>To use this method, you must provide an asynchronous callback when you create the sink writer. Otherwise, the method returns <strong>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</strong>. For more information, see <see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SinkWriterAttributeKeys.AsyncCallback"/>.</p><p>Markers provide a way to be notified when the media sink consumes all of the samples in a stream up to a certain point. The media sink does not process the marker until it has processed all of the samples that came before the marker. When the media sink processes the marker, the sink writer calls the application's <strong>OnMarker</strong> method. When the callback is invoked, you know that the sink has consumed all of the previous samples for that stream.</p><p>For example, to change the format midstream, call <strong>PlaceMarker</strong> at the point where the format changes.

            <p>There are two common uses for this method:</p><ul> <li>To change the default stream selection. Some media files contain multiple streams of the same type. For example, a file might include audio streams for multiple languages. You can use this method to change which of the streams is selected. To get information about each stream, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.GetPresentationAttribute(System.Int32,System.Guid)"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.GetNativeMediaType(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/></strong>.</li> <li>If you will not need data from one of the streams, it is a good idea to deselect that stream. If the stream is selected, the media source might hold onto a queue of unread data, and the queue might grow indefinitely, consuming memory. </li> </ul><p>For an example of deselecting a stream, see Tutorial: Decoding Audio.</p><p>If a stream is deselected, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.ReadSample(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReaderControlFlags,System.Int32@,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReaderFlags@,System.Int64@)"/></strong> method returns <strong>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</strong> for that stream. Other <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader"/></strong> methods are valid for deselected streams.</p><p>Stream selection does not affect how the source reader loads or unloads decoders in memory. In particular, deselecting a stream does not force the source reader to unload the decoder for that stream.</p><p>This interface is available on Windows?Vista if Platform Update Supplement for Windows?Vista is installed.</p>

            <p>There are two common uses for this method:</p><ul> <li>To change the default stream selection. Some media files contain multiple streams of the same type. For example, a file might include audio streams for multiple languages. You can use this method to change which of the streams is selected. To get information about each stream, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.GetPresentationAttribute(System.Int32,System.Guid)"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.GetNativeMediaType(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/></strong>.</li> <li>If you will not need data from one of the streams, it is a good idea to deselect that stream. If the stream is selected, the media source might hold onto a queue of unread data, and the queue might grow indefinitely, consuming memory. </li> </ul><p>For an example of deselecting a stream, see Tutorial: Decoding Audio.</p><p>If a stream is deselected, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader.ReadSample(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReaderControlFlags,System.Int32@,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReaderFlags@,System.Int64@)"/></strong> method returns <strong>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</strong> for that stream. Other <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SourceReader"/></strong> methods are valid for deselected streams.</p><p>Stream selection does not affect how the source reader loads or unloads decoders in memory. In particular, deselecting a stream does not force the source reader to unload the decoder for that stream.</p><p>This interface is available on Windows?Vista if Platform Update Supplement for Windows?Vista is installed.</p>

            <p> This method creates any intermediate transforms that are needed to complete the topology. It also sets the input and output media types on all of the objects in the topology. If the method succeeds, the full topology is returned in the <em>ppOutputTopo</em> parameter. </p><p> You can use the <em>pCurrentTopo</em> parameter to provide a full topology that was previously loaded. If this topology contains objects that are needed in the new topology, the topology loader can re-use them without creating them again. This caching can potentially make the process faster. The objects from <em>pCurrentTopo</em> will not be reconfigured, so you can specify a topology that is actively streaming data. For example, while a topology is still running, you can pre-load the next topology. </p><p> Before calling this method, you must ensure that the output nodes in the partial topology have valid <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.StreamSink"/></strong> references, not <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Activate"/></strong> references. The Media Session automatically performs this action inside the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaSession.SetTopology(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Topology)"/></strong> method. However, if you call <strong>Load</strong> before calling <strong>SetTopology</strong>, you must bind the output nodes manually. For more information, see Binding Output Nodes to Media Sinks. </p>

However, an input stream and an output stream can share the same identifier. </p><p> If the client adds an input stream, the client assigns the identifier, so the MFT must allow arbitrary identifiers, as long as they are unique. If the MFT creates an output stream, the MFT assigns the identifier. </p><p> By convention, if an MFT has exactly one fixed input stream and one fixed output stream, it should assign the identifier 0 to both streams. </p><p>If <strong>MFT_UNIQUE_METHOD_NAMES</strong> is defined before including mftransform.h, this method is renamed <strong>MFTGetStreamIDs</strong>.

            <p> If the transform has a fixed number of input streams, the method returns <strong>E_NOTIMPL</strong>. </p><p> An MFT might support this method but not allow certain input streams to be removed. If an input stream can be removed, the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.GetInputStreamInfo(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TInputStreamInformation@)"/></strong> method returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftInputStreamInformationFlags.MftInputStreamRemovable"/></strong> flag for that stream. Otherwise, the stream cannot be removed, and the method returns <strong>MF_E_INVALIDREQUEST</strong>. The method also fails if the MFT currently has the minimum number of input streams that it requires.

If the method succeeds, the MFT will continue to process the remaining input after the stream is removed. If the method returns <strong>MF_E_TRANSFORM_INPUT_REMAINING</strong>, you must clear the input buffers before removing the stream. To clear the input buffers, either call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessOutput(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer,System.Int32)"/></strong> or else call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessMessage(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TMessageType,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> with the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TMessageType.CommandFlush"/></strong> to flush the MFT.

To enumerate the available types, increment <em>dwTypeIndex</em> until the method returns MF_<strong>E_NO_MORE_TYPES</strong>. </p><p> Setting the media type on one stream can change the available types for another stream (or change the preference order). However, an MFT is not required to update the list of available types dynamically.

A partial media type contains an incomplete description of a format, and is used to provide a hint to the caller. For example, a partial type might include just the major type and subtype GUIDs. However, after the client sets the input types on the MFT, the MFT should generally return at least one complete output type, which can be used without further modification. For more information, see Complete and Partial Media Types.</p><p>Some MFTs cannot provide an accurate list of output types until the MFT receives the first input sample. For example, the MFT might need to read the first packet header to deduce the format. An MFT should handle this situation as follows:</p><ol> <li> Before the MFT receives any input, it offers a list of one or more output types that it could possibly produce. For example, an MPEG-2 decoder might return a media type that describes the MPEG-2 main profile/main level. </li> <li> The client selects one of these types (generally the first) and sets it on the output stream. </li> <li> The client delivers the first input sample by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessInput(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample,System.Int32)"/></strong>. </li> <li> If the output type does not conform to the input data, the transform signals a format change in the <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> method. For more information about format changes, see <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessOutput(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer,System.Int32)"/></strong>. </li> <li> The calls <strong>GetOutputAvailableType</strong> again. At this point, the method should return an updated list of types that reflects the input data. </li> <li> The client selects a new output type from this list and calls <strong>SetOutputType</strong>. </li> </ol><p>If <strong>MFT_UNIQUE_METHOD_NAMES</strong> is defined before including mftransform.h, this method is renamed <strong>MFTGetOutputAvailableType</strong>.

            <p> This method can be used to optimize preroll, especially in formats that have gaps between time stamps, or formats where the data must start on a sync point, such as MPEG-2. Calling this method is optional, and implementation of this method by an MFT is optional. If the MFT does not implement the method, the return value is <strong>E_NOTIMPL</strong>.</p><p> If an MFT implements this method, it must limit its output data to the range of times specified by <em>hnsLowerBound</em> and <em>hnsUpperBound</em>. The MFT discards any input data that is not needed to produce output within this range. If the sample boundaries do not exactly match the range, the MFT should split the output samples, if possible. Otherwise, the output samples can overlap the range. </p><p> For example, suppose the output range is 100 to 150 milliseconds (ms), and the output format is video with each frame lasting 33 ms. A sample with a time stamp of 67 ms overlaps the range (67 + 33 = 100) and is produced as output. A sample with a time stamp of  66 ms is discarded (66 + 33 = 99). Similarly, a sample with a time stamp of 150 ms is produced as output, but a sample with a time stamp of 151 is discarded.</p><p>If <strong>MFT_UNIQUE_METHOD_NAMES</strong> is defined before including mftransform.h, this method is renamed <strong>MFTSetOutputBounds</strong>.

            <remarks>	
            <p> In most cases, if the method succeeds, the MFT stores the sample and holds a reference count on the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample"/></strong> reference. Do not re-use the sample until the MFT releases the sample. Instead of storing the sample, however, an MFT might copy the sample data into a new buffer. In that case, the MFT should set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftInputStreamInformationFlags.MftInputStreamDoesNotAddref"/></strong> flag in the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.GetInputStreamInfo(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TInputStreamInformation@)"/></strong> method. </p><p> If the MFT already has enough input data to produce an output sample, it does not accept new input data, and <strong>ProcessInput</strong> returns <strong>MF_E_NOTACCEPTING</strong>. At that point, the client should clear the pending input data by doing one of the following: </p><ul> <li> Generate new output by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessOutput(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer,System.Int32)"/></strong>. </li> <li> Flush the input data by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessMessage(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TMessageType,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> with the MFT_<strong>MESSAGE_COMMAND_FLUSH</strong> message. </li> </ul><p> An exception to this rule is the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputStreamInformationFlags.MftOutputStreamLazyRead"/></strong> flag. When this flag is present, the transform will discard stored samples if you give it more input. For more information, see <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.GetOutputStreamInfo(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputStreamInformation@)"/></strong>. A transform should never queue any more input data than is required to produce the correct output. </p><p> An MFT can process the input data in the <strong>ProcessInput</strong> method. However, most MFTs wait until the client calls <strong>ProcessOutput</strong>. </p><p> After the client has set valid media types on all of the streams, the MFT should always be in one of two states: Able to accept more input, or able to produce more output. It should never be in both states or neither state. An MFT should only accept as much input as it needs to generate at least one output sample, at which point <strong>ProcessInput</strong> returns <strong>MF_E_NOTACCEPTING</strong>. When <strong>ProcessInput</strong> returns <strong>MF_E_NOTACCEPTING</strong>, the client can assume that the MFT is ready to produce output. </p><p> If an MFT encounters a non-fatal error in the input data, it can simply drop the data and attempt to recover when it gets the more input data. To request more input data, the MFT returns <strong>MF_E_TRANSFORM_NEED_MORE_INPUT</strong> from the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessOutput(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer,System.Int32)"/></strong> method. If the MFT drops any data, it should set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.SampleAttributeKeys.Discontinuity"/></strong> attribute attribute on the next output sample, to notify the caller that there is a gap in the data stream. </p><p>If <strong>MFT_UNIQUE_METHOD_NAMES</strong> is defined before including mftransform.h, this method is renamed <strong>MFTProcessInput</strong>.

            <p> The size of the <em>pOutputSamples</em> array must be equal to or greater than the number of <em>selected</em> output streams. The number of selected output streams equals the total number of output streams minus the number of <em>deselected</em> streams. A stream is deselected if it has the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputStreamInformationFlags.MftOutputStreamOptional"/></strong> flag and the caller does not set a media type (or sets the media type to <strong><c>null</c></strong>). For more information, see <strong>_MFT_OUTPUT_STREAM_INFO_FLAGS</strong> enumeration. </p><p>This method generates output samples and can also generate events. If the method succeeds, at least one of the following conditions is true:</p><ul> <li> One or more samples in the <em>pOutputSamples</em> array contains output data. </li> <li> One or more members of the <em>pOutputSamples</em> array contains a non-empty collection of events. </li> </ul><p>If <strong>MFT_UNIQUE_METHOD_NAMES</strong> is defined before including Mftransform.h, this method is renamed <strong>MFTProcessOutput</strong>. See Creating Hybrid DMO/MFT Objects.</p>Output Buffers<p>The MFT returns output data for a stream through the <strong>pSample</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure. This structure member is a reference to the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Sample"/></strong> interface of a media sample. (See Media Samples.) The media sample is allocated either by the caller or by the MFT, depending on the MFT's allocation model. To find the allocation model, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.GetOutputStreamInfo(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputStreamInformation@)"/></strong> and examine the <strong>dwFlags</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputStreamInformation"/></strong> structure:</p><ul> <li> If the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputStreamInformationFlags.MftOutputStreamProvidesSamples"/></strong> flag is present, the MFT allocates the media sample. </li> <li> If the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputStreamInformationFlags.MftOutputStreamCanProvideSamples"/></strong> flag is present, the caller can optionally provide a media sample. If <strong>pSample</strong> is <strong><c>null</c></strong>, the MFT will allocate the media sample. </li> <li> If neither of these two flags is present, the caller must allocate the media sample. </li> </ul><p>These flags remain constant unless the media type for the output stream changes.</p><p>If the caller allocates the media sample, the media sample must contain a buffer that is large enough to hold the output data. To find the buffer requirements, call <strong>GetOutputStreamInfo</strong>. The MFT writes the output data to the start of the buffer, overwriting any data that already exists in the buffer.</p><p>If the MFT allocates the sample, the MFT also allocates the buffers for the sample.</p><p>If the MFT has multiple output streams, the streams might produce output at different rates, so some streams might have output while other streams do not. If a stream did not any produce output, the MFT sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferNoSample"/></strong> flag in the <strong>dwStatus</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure for that stream. In that case, if the caller allocated <strong>pSample</strong>, the buffers in the sample do not contain any valid data. If the caller did not allocate <strong>pSample</strong>, the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferNoSample"/></strong> flag indicates that <strong>pSample</strong> still equals <strong><c>null</c></strong> after the method returns.</p><p>If no output streams have data, and the MFT has no events to return, then <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> returns <strong>MF_E_TRANSFORM_NEED_MORE_INPUT</strong>.</p><p>The MFT cannot return more than one sample per stream in a single call to <strong>ProcessOutput</strong>. If there is more output data available for a stream after <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> returns, the MFT sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferIncomplete"/></strong> flag in the <strong>dwStatus</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure for that stream.</p><p>If the MFT has enough data to produce output, it should refuse to accept any more input until <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> has been called enough times to pull all of the available output. (An exception is when the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.GetOutputStreamInfo(System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputStreamInformation@)"/></strong> method returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputStreamInformationFlags.MftOutputStreamLazyRead"/></strong> flag.) Generally, an MFT with multiple output streams should produce output for a stream as soon as possible, and not wait for all of the streams to have output.</p>In-Band Events<p>The MFT can return a collection of event objects in the <strong>pEvents</strong> member of each <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure. The MFT allocates both the collection object and the events.</p><p>To send an event to the caller, the MFT performs the following steps inside <strong>ProcessOutput</strong>:</p><ol> <li> Create a new collection object by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.CreateCollection(SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Collection@)"/></strong>. </li> <li> Add one or more events to the collection by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Collection.AddElement(SharpDX.ComObject)"/></strong>. </li> <li> Set the <strong>pEvents</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure equal to the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Collection"/></strong> reference. The MFT leaves a reference count on this interface; the caller must release the reference. </li> </ol><p>Events do not have time stamps. The caller should process the events before processing the output samples. In other words, events occur at the point in the stream immediately after the previous call to <strong>ProcessOutput</strong>, and prior to any output samples returned from the current <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> call.</p><p>It is valid for the <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> method to return one or more events and zero output samples.</p><p>The caller is responsible for releasing any events that the MFT allocates. When the method returns, check the <strong>pEvents</strong> member of each <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure. If the value is not <strong><c>null</c></strong>, the caller must release the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Collection"/></strong> interface reference:</p><pre>// Release the events that an MFT might allocate in <see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.Transform.ProcessOutput(System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer,System.Int32)"/>().	
            void ReleaseEventCollection(DWORD cOutputBuffers, <see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/>* pBuffers)	
            { for (DWORD i = 0; i &lt; cOutputBuffers; i++) { if (pBuffers[i].pEvents) { pBuffers[i].pEvents-&gt;Release(); pBuffers[i].pEvents = <c>null</c>; } }	
            }	
            </pre><p>An MFT should not use the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaEventGenerator"/></strong> interface to send in-band events.</p>Stream Changes<p>The <strong>ProcessOutput</strong> method can cause any of the following changes in an output stream:</p><ul> <li> The deletion of an output stream. To signal a stream deletion, the MFT sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferStreamEnd"/></strong> flag in the <strong>dwStatus</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure for that stream. </li> <li> The creation of a new output stream. To signal a new output stream, the MFT sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftProcessOutputStatus.MftProcessOutputStatusNewStreams"/></strong> flag in the <em>pdwStatus</em> parameter. A new stream can have the same stream identifier as a deleted stream. </li> <li> A format change on an output stream. To signal a format change, the MFT sets the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferFormatChange"/></strong> flag in the <strong>dwStatus</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TOutputDataBuffer"/></strong> structure for that stream. </li> </ul><p>It is possible that all three of these actions will result from a single call to <strong>ProcessOutput</strong>. The caller must respond to them in the order listed here?first deletions, then additions, then format changes.</p><p>The <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferFormatChange"/></strong> flag signals a format change on an output stream. This might mean the current media type has become invalid, or the preference order has changed and a more efficient format is available. In the latter case, it is possible that the client will re-set the original media type. To guard against endless loops, the MFT should not set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MftOutputDataBufferFlags.MftOutputDataBufferFormatChange"/></strong> flag again until there is another change. Also, avoid setting this flag if the preference order changes but the current media type is still the most preferred type.</p>Sample Attributes<p>An input sample might have attributes, which are accessed through the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaAttributes"/></strong> interface. Unless a specific attribute no longer applies, all attributes should be copied into the corresponding output sample. The responsibily for copying attributes is determined as follows:</p><ul> <li> If the value of the <strong>MFPKEY_EXATTRIBUTE_SUPPORTED</strong> property on the MFT is <strong>VARIANT_TRUE</strong>, the MFT copies the attributes. </li> <li> If the value of <strong>MFPKEY_EXATTRIBUTE_SUPPORTED</strong> is <strong>VARIANT_FALSE</strong>, or the property is not set, the client must copy the sample attributes. Do not overwrite any attributes that the MFT sets on the output sample. </li> </ul><p>For a list of sample attributes, see Sample Attributes.</p>Asynchronous Processing<p>The previous remarks describe the <em>synchronous</em> processing model. To support asynchronous processing, see Asynchronous MFTs.</p>

            <p>This method provides a way for the plug-in to report temporary conditions that would cause the input trust authority (ITA) to distrust the plug-in. For example, if an EVR presenter is in windowed mode, it is vulnerable to GDI screen captures.</p><p>To disable screen capture in Direct3D, the plug-in must do the following:</p><ul> <li> <p>Create the Direct3D device in full-screen exlusive mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D9.CreateFlags.DisablePrintScreen"/> flag when you create the device. For more information, see <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3D.CreateDevice"/></strong> in the DirectX documentation.</p> </li> </ul><p>In addition, the graphics adapter must support the Windows Vista Display Driver Model (WDDM) and the Direct3D extensions for Windows Vista (sometimes called D3D9Ex or D3D9L).</p><p>If these conditions are met, the presenter can return <strong>TRUE</strong> in the <em>pYes</em> parameter. Otherwise, it should return <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>.</p><p>The EVR calls this method whenever the device changes. If the plug-in returns <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>, the EVR treats this condition as if the plug-in had a new output connector of unknown type. The policy object can then allow or block playback, depending on the ITA's policy.</p><p>This method should be used only to report transient conditions. A plug-in that is never in a trusted state should not implement the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.TrustedVideoPlugin"/></strong> interface at all.</p>

Also, the X and Y coordinates of the upper-left corner cannot exceed the X and Y coordinates of the lower-right corner. In other words, the bounding rectangle must fit entirely within the composition rectangle and cannot be flipped vertically or horizontally. </p><p>The following diagram shows how the EVR mixes substreams.</p><p>The output rectangle for the stream is specified by calling <strong>SetStreamOutputRect</strong>. The source rectangle is specified by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.MediaFoundation.VideoDisplayControl.SetVideoPosition(System.Nullable{SharpDX.MediaFoundation.VideoNormalizedRect},System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})"/></strong>. The mixer applies the output rectangle first, when it mixes the streams into a single bounding rectangle. This bounding rectangle is called <em>composition space</em>. Then the presenter applies the source rectangle to the composited image.</p>

            <p><strong>Applies to: </strong>desktop apps | Metro style apps</p><p> </p><p>Defines a normalized rectangle, which is used to specify sub-rectangles in a video rectangle. When a rectangle N is <em>normalized</em> relative to some other rectangle R, it means the following:</p><ul> <li> <p>The coordinate (0.0, 0.0) on N is mapped to the upper-left corner of R.</p> </li> <li> <p>The coordinate (1.0, 1.0) on N is mapped to the lower-right corner of R.</p> </li> </ul><p>Any coordinates of N that fall outside the range [0...1] are mapped to positions outside the rectangle R. A normalized rectangle can be used to specify a region within a video rectangle without knowing the resolution or even the aspect ratio of the video. For example, the upper-left quadrant is defined as {0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5}.</p>
